The main purpose of this paper was to provide a survey of dynamic program analysis techniques and tools. Generally, a dynamic analysis technique involves two phases: 1) program instrumentation and profile/trace generation, 2) analysis or monitoring. Moreover, the dynamic program analysis techniques were classified into three categories: 1) Instrumentation Based, 2) VM profiling Based, 3) AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming) Based. Their merits and demerits were listed in the paper. Addtionally, many C++/Java-targeted tools were introduced in the paper.\nEnglish Learning\n\nwords:\npolymorphism\nmerit, demerit\ninvaluable\ndrawback\nexpertise\nphrases:\ngive emphasis on\ndevise techniques\ngather information\nrender static analysis imprecise\nrun-time overheads\nviolations of properties\ntechnical phrases:\nprogram instrumentation\nprofile/trace generation\n\n","tags":["program analysis, paper reading, summary"]},{"title":"hexo博客挂载到github pages","url":"/home/2022/01/09/hexo-hexo%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E6%8C%82%E8%BD%BD%E5%88%B0github/","content":"1.按照github pages的官方文档教程建立自己的github网站。\n2.按照hexo的官方文档安装hexo。\n3.重点来了，如何将hexo生成的静态网页自动推到github上？(有坑)\n\n安装插件hexo-deployer-git:\n\nnpm install --save hexo-deployer-git\n\n修改blog根目录里的_config.yml文件:（有坑）\n\n网上教程需要修改\ndeploy:  type: git  repo: your git website repository  branch: your branch\n实测还需要修改\nurl: websiteroot: your webstie root\n修改完成执行命令即可\nhexo clean hexo g hexo d","categories":["博客搭建"],"tags":["hexo","github pages"]},{"title":"雅思口语","url":"/home/2022/01/11/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D-%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D%E5%8F%A3%E8%AF%ADday1/","content":"day1\nSimon的雅思翻转课堂\n重音的阅读方式为 下上下，需要重读的场景：\n\n主谓宾的宾语\n短语的最后一个\n你所表达的关键词语\n一般重读都是名词。\n\n练习积累\n练习了part1, Are you interested in fashion or clothes fashion?\n答：No, I’m not interested in fashion.
